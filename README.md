# Getting Started with Create React App

Last week I realized I had been coding so far and not actually programming so here's my first full program with the guide of code along programers(I picked a very old video so i was forced to find the new commands or what exactly it did so i had to find alternatives. It was a great way to challenge myself and still start from somewhere no completely blind)
My Instagram clone is a sipley post sharing platform. You can select an image from local storage, write a caption, upload file and know the progress with the progress bar. You can also make comments and delete your own posts. 


What I learned from this project:

-This project taught me how to implement a firebase database, config etc.
-How to access database and with the help of JS and React play around.
-I learned how to create users, implement buttons, limit who sees what(after HOURS of study. Totally worth it).
-Taught me how the backend meets the frontend.I am able to visualise how the data flows into the code and find errors.
-I learned about useStates and useEffects and its MANY benefits
-How a templete can be created using props and how to instantly generate a post with custom caption, images and usernames. It all came together so well in the end.
-I loved pairing up a button with an image with div tags and labels
-I got to implement Modals
-I got familiar with different files and how to import them with ease.
React and firebase go hand in hand.


My personal touches are:

-Delete post button(my biggest achievement in this program)
-the entire lower bar, upload button, plusIcon etc
-SignUp, SignIn and Login buttons
-Display Username of the account user
-Instagram Icon


I plan to implement and add:

-Likes button and count
-Edit and Delete buttons for the comments
-Feedback box
-Messaging area
-User profile and stored posts
-email verification


I would love feedback on what I can improve or if you have any ideas<333

I will add the web app link here when it's is successfully deployed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
